*FIRST OF ALL*
To use Nuitrack on any device (Windows, IOS, Android, Linux, etc.), you need to install the appropriate software https://github.com/3DiVi/nuitrack-sdk/blob/master/doc/Install.md

*QUICKSTART*
Run AllModulesScene. If you see some errors then follow the on-screen instructions. 
If nothing help go to https://github.com/3DiVi/nuitrack-sdk/blob/master/doc/Troubleshooting.md.
If the problem persists and you decide to contact support, attach the Unity Editor.log from %LOCALAPPDATA%/Unity/Editor

*Prefabs*
In NuitracSDK you can find much useful prefabs. They are sorted by functionality and are located in the corresponding folders

*Nuitrack Scripts Prefab*
It's a base prefab. He must be on stage at the time of using Nuitrack.
Tip:If your project has several scenes, it is recommended to place it at the very beginning on a separate scene. 
This is a DontDestroyOnLoad-prefab, and therefore it will be possible to use one instance of this prefab, it will move between scenes

Modules (https://github.com/3DiVi/nuitrack-sdk/blob/master/doc/Architecture.md):
- Depth - data from depth frame
- Color - data from RGB frame
- User Tracker - Finds users in the frame. User Mask
- Skeleton Tracker - tracks skeletons. Can track 19 joint on 6 users
- Gestures Recognizer - Tracks gestures made with your hands. Waving, Swipe Left, Swipe Right, Swipe Up, Swipe Down, Push
- Hands Tracker - Tracks the hands in some virtual area in front of the person. You can use it to control some user interface

Options:
- WiFi connect - You can receive data via Wi-Fi from TVico and VicoVR (No longer available). At the moment, only the skeleton data is available (https://github.com/3DiVi/nuitrack-sdk/blob/master/doc/TVico_User_Guide.md#setting-up-tvico)
- Run in background - There is no stopping Nuitrack when the window\application is minimized
- Async init - Nuitrack starts in a separate thread. This removes a slight hang when starting work. But then you need to make sure that no scripts will try to get data from Nuitrack before initializing Nuitrack.
Tip: You can disable the necessary prefab, and enable it after initialization by placing it in the Init Event field (you can see an example on the AllModulesScene scene)
- Init Event - The event that is called after Nuitrack is initialized. You can put here any actions that should be called after initialization
- use file record - Insert this path of your *.oni or *.bag file and you can use the recording instead of the sensor (~3 min). If you want to stop using it, uncheck the box. (You may also need to restart the editor)

[Sets values in Nuitrack\nuitrack\nuitrack\data\nuitrack.config so that you don't have to manually edit this file. 
If you have previously edited the values in nuitrack.config, they will have a higher priority than the checkboxes on the prefab. (it is recommended not to edit nuitrack.config at all)]
Config parameters:
- Depth 2 Color Registration - Aligns the data from the RGB frame and the depth frame. Accuracy increases, but performance on weak devices may also decrease.
- Use Face Tracking - Enables face tracking. Face rectangle, Emotions, Age, Gender, Years. (Works only with the skeleton!)
- Nuitrack AI - Enables Nuitrack Ai algoritms. Skeleton and Object trackings. (PC ONLY!) More: https://github.com/3DiVi/nuitrack-sdk/blob/master/doc/Nuitrack_AI.md
- Mirror - Mirrors sensor data (rgb, depth, skeleton, etc.)
